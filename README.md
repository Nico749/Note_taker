## General info

The application allows an user to insert, save and delete simple notes he needs to manage. Once he digits the content of a note, a save button can be clicked and save the note; if he clicks on the red bin aside the note title, that note will be deleted; if he clicks on a specific note, it will be displayed as the active note

## Project Status

* Backend working as expected
* Frontend need to be reviewed 

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
* Connect the backend with the frontend properly, so if we click on every icon, this works as it should
* Add a new note dynamically because at the moment to see a new note added to our list we need to restart the app

## Installation

The application is deployed on heroku on: (https://damp-plateau-74738.herokuapp.com/)
